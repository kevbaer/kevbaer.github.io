### **Reds Hackathon 2025 Entry ([Link](https://kevbaer.quarto.pub/wan-k-comp/){target="_blank"})**

#### *Finished 2nd*

This is the code notebook to go along with my submission for Nick Wan’s “**Predict strikeouts with new MLB arm angle data”** competition. It’s finals week here at UCLA, so I didn’t have time to really dig into this project. But what I did decide to do was make models in R, Python, and Julia! At its core, it’s a simple model using just the \~150k rows with two strikes in the training set. I believe that this choice allows a much more straightforward process as our train data is more comparable to the test data.

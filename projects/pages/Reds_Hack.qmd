### **Reds Hackathon 2025 Entry ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kevinbaer/predicting-future-playing-time){target="_blank"})**

#### *Finished 2nd in both the code and presentation portions of the competition*

In this Hackathon, I developed two ML models to predict future playing for pitchers and hitters from past statistics. I then used permutation based variable importance to inspect the top 10 features for each model to generate insights for front offices!

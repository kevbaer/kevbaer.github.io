I’m currently president of Bruin Sports Analytics, where we do consulting work for a variety of UCLA Division I teams. When I’m not coding, you can find me playing oboe in HOOLIGAN Theatre Company, watching the UCLA men’s volleyball team, or planning DataFest, the largest Data Science hackathon on the West Coast. I love the Sydney Opera House, apples, chess, playing volleyball, and musical theater.\nOn this website, you’ll find my research projects, competition papers, resume, and other fun things.

    "text": "CMU Sports Analytics Conference 2024 Entry (Link)\n\nWith support from UCLA Undergraduate Research Grant and Professor Dave Zes\nCurrent volleyball statistics often fail to capture the nuanced performance of players since they are limited to binary outputs of success or failure, similar to stats like batting average or completion percentage. The purpose of this study is to build comprehensive statistics to measure player performance, predict future and hypothetical match outcomes, and enhance viewer enjoyment of volleyball. 6,531 ball contacts from the U19 and U21 Men’s NORCECA Championships were defined and encoded into a pair of values, an input and an output of each touch. The input value represents the quality of the ball before contact, and the output value represents the quality of the ball after contact, allowing for analysis of the individual impact of the contact by taking the difference between the output win probability and the input win probability. My methodology introduces predictive and evaluative metrics, such as position rankings, pre-game win percentages, action-specific rankings, and in-point win probability graphs, offering a richer perspective for players, coaches, and viewers. Different actions can be compared, such as the value of one player’s blocking versus another’s digging, through the player and skill-specific percentage added averages. Players get credit for their direct impact on the point, whether the result is a kill, an overpass, or an out-of-system dig. Teams are assigned a rating based on the performance of all seven starters compared to the average team, allowing for team rankings and win probabilities for hypothetical matchups. These new statistics enable more nuanced comparisons and insights into player performance, tailored to the context of their environment than simple counting stats. Further research could explore opponent adjustments, baseline probabilities for different leagues, and automation of these metrics on platforms like Volleymetrics or VolleyStation to further enhance speed and accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see the code, click here!"

    "text": "Big Data Bowl 2024 Entry (Link)\nSwarm Score is a quantitative assessment of the age-old football maxim of rallying to the football and swarming the ball carrier. The statistic is formed by comparing each defender’s bivariate normal spatial influence probability density function against the ball carrier’s spatial influence model to determine how many defenders are swarming the ball carrier to maximize tackling efficiency. Swarm Score proves to be an effective success measure of a variety of tackling statistics such as YAC allowed, YAC over expected allowed, seconds from catch till tackle, EPA allowed, and many more. Finally, Swarm Score is shown to be a much better predictor of future YAC allowed than prior YAC allowed performance, demonstrating it’s stability and effective value.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo read the full paper, click here!\nTo see the code, click here!"

We start with a quick explanation of NFL contracts and how to evaluate them, explain our adjustments for salary cap inflation, and then explore the four distinct compensation clusters and how they’ve changed from the past (2015-2017) to the present (2022-2024). We then provide some thoughts on changes in the NFL’s middle-class player stability and success before giving four suggestions on NFLPA advocacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo read the full paper, click here!"
